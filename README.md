# Fire-Fighting-Robot
Final Year Project 
An IoT-enabled fire-fighting robot detects and extinguishes fires autonomously using flame and temperature
sensors. It features a GPS module for real-time location tracking and a Bluetooth module for short-range
manual control. The robot sends live data and alerts to a remote server, ensuring efficient monitoring and
safety in hazardous environments.
